# Image Encryption
                                                     
Image encryption and decryption are cybersecurity techniques used to protect digital images from unauthorized access by transforming them into an unreadable format. Encryption scrambles the image data, making it secure for transmission or storage, while decryption reverses the process to restore the image to its original state. This process relies on cryptographic algorithms and keys to ensure the security of the image. 

# How it works:

1. **Encryption:**
An image is converted to an encrypted version using a secret key and a cryptographic algorithm. 
2. **Decryption:**
The encrypted image can only be decrypted and restored to its original form using the same secret key and the corresponding decryption algorithm. 
3. **Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption:**
Symmetric Encryption: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, making it efficient but requiring secure key exchange. 
Asymmetric Encryption: Uses a pair of keys (public and private), where the public key is used for encryption and the private key for decryption, offering security without the need for key exchange. 

Encryption is the process by which a readable message is converted to an unreadable form to prevent unauthorized parties from reading it. Decryption is the process of converting an encrypted message back to its original (readable) format.
